# Mat's Garage Sale (or Giveaway)
Getting rid of stuff :sparkles:

## What's this?
I'm moving in December 2021. I have a lot of stuff I don't need anymore or don't want to move. I want to get rid of it in a nice way and make someone else happy in the process.

## What are the rules?
- :judge: First/Legal: No guarantees on correctness, I'm not a commercial seller etc. but I'll do my best to provide an accurate description.
- :money_with_wings: I don't want to make a profit per se. I try to ask a fair value but mostly want stuff to be gone and hopefully find a new happy owner.
- :dart: I might put stuff up on Craigslist/eBay and it might sell there in the meantime, will try to keep this list as up to date as possible. If it's gone, it's gone.
- :package: Items are generally for pick up in Seattle-area.
- :love_letter: Most people seeing this repo will know how to contact me. If you don't reach out via Twitter/... - contact info is in my [profile](https://github.com/matthiaswenz). PRs are a good starting point for claiming something. I also put links to the sale itself up for every item.

## What's on sale?

:drum: That's it... we're all done.

## Anything else?
2020/2021 has been tough on all of us. If you know someone in desparate need of something from this list, or a good cause to donate items/proceeds to, let me know.
