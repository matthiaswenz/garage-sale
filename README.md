# Mat's Garage Sale (or Giveaway)
Getting rid of stuff :sparkles:

## What's this?
I'm moving in 2021 â€“ I don't know the exact timing :crystal_ball:. I have a lot of stuff I don't need anymore or don't want to move. I want to get rid of it in a nice way and make someone else happy in the process.

## What are the rules?
- :judge: First/Legal: No guarantees on correctness, I'm not a commercial seller etc. but I'll do my best to provide an accurate description.
- :money_with_wings: I don't want to make a profit per se. I try to ask a fair value but mostly want stuff to be gone and hopefully find a new happy owner.
- :dart: I might put stuff up on Craigslist/eBay and it might sell there in the meantime, will try to keep this list as up to date as possible. If it's gone, it's gone.
- :package: Items are generally for pick up in Seattle-area. I might provide shipping depending on size of article, USPS/UPS/... US-domestic only.
- :love_letter: I generally don't accept PRs, issues, etc. - don't open an issue asking for contact information etc. if you got access to this repo, you'll know how to contact me. Otherwise use platforms like Craigslist, eBay, ...

## What's on sale?
- [:book: Books](books.md)
- [:crystal_ball: Staging area](staging.md)

## Anything else?
2020/2021 has been tough. If you know someone in desparate need of something from this list, or a good cause to donate items/proceeds to, let me know.
