# Mat's Garage Sale (or Giveaway)
Getting rid of stuff :sparkles:

## What's this?
I'm moving in 2021 â€“ I don't know the exact timing :crystal_ball:. I have a lot of stuff I don't need anymore or don't want to move. I want to get rid of it in a nice way and make someone else happy in the process.

## What are the rules?
- :judge: First/Legal: No guarantees on correctness, I'm not a commercial seller etc. but I'll do my best to provide an accurate description.

- :love_letter: Most people seeing this repo will know how to contact me. If you don't feel free to reach out to me via Twitter/... - contact info is in my [profile](https://github.com/matthiaswenz).
